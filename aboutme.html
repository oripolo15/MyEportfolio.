    <h1>This is My Story</h1>
   
    
    <p> 
        My name is Orianna Gomez Polo, my major is Animation and Motion Graphics.

      Ever since I was little I have loved cartoons and animated tv shows, that is something that was encouraged by my parents, but very much criticized by people at school, although that never affected me as a child.

    <h1>
        Why I love animation
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        Groing up in my homecountry Venezuela I continued to watch cartoons, and as the objective and message of cartoons continued to evolve, so did my love and passion for them; Tv shows such as Avatar: The last Airbender, and The Legend of Korra are the proof of that. Animated tv shows are no longer to entertain kids or to make them laugh with fart jokes, but rather stories about real world situations, where the fantasy element allows them to create characters who's actions resemble real-life people's; they are able to show how those actions affect others, and how 
        they can help others based on what kids learned through those cartoons.

        For 2 years I had finally decided to major in Psychology, it was a career that was serious enough for my parents to approve of it, they where excited because I was going to become the family's first doctor, unlike my sister who chose Fine Arts instead of Medicine. Funnily enough when I applied to university I accidentally selected Animation and Motion Graphics instead of Psychology, I asked the person helping me create my schedule to change it to psychology, and then she asked "Are you sure?" I looked at her and I looked at the classes that I would be taking for Animation, I saw classes that I would genuinely enjoy, and that I knew I would be excited to take. At that moment I realized that there was I was on my own, with no one telling me what to do, with no one expecting anything from me, and with that I told her "No, nevermind I will stay with animation" with the second "Are you sure?" coming from her, I realized what I had just said, with the biggest smile and determination I've ever felt in my life I told her "yes, 100% sure". I then continued to do my schedule feeling free; I walked out of the building skipping and about to cry of happiness. Of course my parents weren't really happy with my decision (as it was indeed very sudden) I had to convinced them of the fact that the decision I had made was the right one, my mom cried and my dad didn't said much, but as time went by they were okay with it (mostly because my dad has a friend who's career is also animation, who told my father about animation and that I had chosen a good career. Let's just say that helped too.. a lot).

        My goal is to learn animation, that way I can create my own stories and animate them on my own, I am a strong believer that some projects and some messajes have an ever stronger impact when they are made by the artist, because the message is comming directly from the artist to the audience. I want to do it through animation because I genuinely do love to play with the audiovisual, and because it is sometimes easier for some poeple to understand things through animation (audiovisual). Besides I really like the freedom that I have with Animation, I can create infinite worlds, characters, places, and shapes with animation. I want to create stories that have a message that helps humanity, a message that inspires others to be better people, and to also make others feel less alone in the world. To put it simply, I want to create something that helps people, in one way or the other, I want to help others. Since we do not have superpowers or capes that make us heroes, then I need to find realistic and humanly possible ways to be the hero that animated tv shows have taught me to be.
